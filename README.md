# CC12-Recursion-Control-Structures

## Recursion Lab Activity <br>

### Objective:
<li> To understand and implement recursive functions in Java.
<li> To practice solving problems using recursion. </li>
<li> To explore the recursive calculation of power, sorting using recursion, and counting vowels in a string recursively. </li>

<br>

## Instructions:

### Power Calculation: <br>
<li> Develop a recursive Java function named powerRecursive to calculate the result of raising a base number to an exponent. <br>
<li> Create a Java class with a main method. </li>
<li> Define a recursive function powerRecursive that takes a base number and an exponent as parameters.</li>
<li> Implement the recursive logic to calculate the power.</li>
<li> Test the function with different base and exponent values in the main method.</li>

<br>

### Bubble Sort:
<li> Implement a recursive Java function named recursiveBubbleSort for the Bubble Sort algorithm.
<li> Create a Java class with a main method. </li>
<li> Define a recursive function recursiveBubbleSort that takes an array and its length as parameters.</li>
<li> Implement the recursive Bubble Sort logic to sort the array.</li>
<li> Test the function with different arrays in the main method.</li>

<br>

### Vowel Counter:
<li> Implement a recursive Java function named countVowelsRecursive to count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string.
<li> Create a Java class with a main method.</li>
Define a recursive function countVowelsRecursive that takes a string as a parameter.
Implement the recursive logic to count vowels in the string.
Test the function with different strings containing vowels in the main method.
